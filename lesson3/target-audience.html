                    Description: Our target audience is people from 12 to 100 years old. They have active lives and care about the climatical conditions. The target audience may have a full-time job or a long day in school and some sportive activities. Usually, they depend on the weather to perform some exercises. The income of the user doesn't matter since this is going to be a costless app. The objective is to be an intuitive use website, so the user doesn't need to have any experience using weather websites or apps.
                    The user may access the website in a hurry, just before leaving home or some roofed place. So, the most common device will be a mobile device.
