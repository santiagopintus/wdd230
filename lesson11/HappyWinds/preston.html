                <p>LOGAN — A single line from the three-page typewritten letter leaped out at Maxine Fisher in July 2009. She read the words from a stranger over and over, stunned and numb with disbelief: “I have reason to believe you are my mother.”</p>
                <p>The author of the letter, Gene Williams, wrote that there had been a mix-up in the Preston, Idaho, hospital 65 years earlier, and Maxine and another woman’s babies had been switched.</p>
                <p>Maxine, now 98, still lives at home by herself on a quiet street in this northern Utah community. She is lively, sharp and fiercely independent. Although skeptical of his claim that he could be her son, she said Gene’s letter still shook her to the core.</p>
                <p>“It was so ridiculous, I just couldn’t believe it,” Maxine said. “Preston is a small town, and everybody knows everybody. I knew all the nurses by their first names, and I didn’t think the nurses had switched my baby.”</p>
                <p>She worried at first it might be a scam but still replied in careful penmanship on a single page.</p>
                <p>“I wish the shock of it had put me in my grave,” she wrote back to Gene. “I’m crying, I’m shaking, walking around in a daze. I’m sick to my stomach, my mind’s boggled. I can’t face it but I can’t disregard it.”</p>
                <p>Maxine said her main concern was for her son, Rod. She’d raised him and been his mother for 65 years. If what this stranger Gene claimed in his letter was true, she didn’t want to think about the impact on the tight-knit Fisher family.</p>
                <p>With powerful online search engines enabling anyone with an internet connection to access countless databases and historical records, stories about adoptees finding their biological parents and others accidentally discovering long-lost relatives have become commonplace. The affordability and ease of DNA testing — requiring only a simple swab of saliva — has also provided unimpeachable evidence of someone's origins.</p>
                <p>But none of that existed in April 1963, when Gene, then 19, was about to serve a mission to Mexico for his church. His parents, Cecil Williams and Eva Belnap, had divorced when he was only 14 months old. Gene remained with his father, who remarried and settled in Phoenix, Arizona, where Gene grew up. After receiving his mission call from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Gene and his father were driving from Arizona to Utah to drop him off in Salt Lake City for missionary training.</p>
                <p>On the way, Gene’s father drove him through Preston to show him where he was born and visit a few family members still in the area, including his maternal grandmother, Martha Belnap. As they were leaving, she left him with a cryptic secret.</p>

                <p>Grandma Belnap told him to look for another new missionary named Rodney Fisher, who she said would also be at missionary training the same day as Gene. She said something about Gene and this other boy Rod having been mixed up as babies at the hospital.</p>
                <p>“She said, ‘Don’t worry about the babies being switched because I got you to the right mothers, and everything is fine,’” Gene said.</p>
                <p>It was the first time he had ever heard anything about a baby switch.</p>
                <p>A few days later in Salt Lake City, he met the missionary his grandmother had told him about. Among the crowd of 220 other new missionaries, he recognized Rod from a distance.</p>
                <p>“It just hit me like a bolt of lightning,” Gene said. “I remember thinking, that kid looks just like my dad.”</p>
                <p>The two briefly exchanged pleasantries. Gene was on his way to preach in Mexico for two years, and Rod to his own mission in Canada. With that, they went their separate ways.</p>
